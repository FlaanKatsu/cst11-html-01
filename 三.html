    <p>So the buffalo had a male and a female. And to the same area where he molded the different animals, He took clay, he molded it into a person. He opened its mouth and blew into it. It started breathing. He already tanned some hides for the breech cloth, leggings and shirt. And as they were walking away, He was to be able to communicate with all the different animals. And He communicated with the man. And He figured: “I made all the animals in pairs. Let’s go back to that clay and I’ll make the woman.” So they went back to the clay and they molded a woman, clothed her with buck skin.</p>
