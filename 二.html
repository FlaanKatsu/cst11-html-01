    <p >He said to himself, “I should put on Mother Earth, people similar to me, so they can make use of the buffalo.” This natural area had natural boundaries. To the South was the Yellowstone River and to the West was the Rocky Mountains, as far North as the Saskatchewan River, East to the Cyprus Hills. Now He knew all the areas and when He put the buffalo on Mother Earth, He built, He put everything in twos, the male and female. </p>
